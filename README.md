# Storybook HTML Starter
Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation. This starter template uses only HTML - no JS framework required.

## Intro
I created this starter to help those wishing to get started with `Storybook for HTML`. Although storybook **does** come with a quick start guide, it is relatively simple, and doesn't really showcase a more fully laid out component system. A lot of the Storybook tutorials focus on React and/or use the older Storybook 4.x syntax, which can be confusing.

## Features
- Just HTML! You don't need to know React or Vue to get started with building and visualizing components.
- Uses `Declarative Storybook Configuration`, a new simpler, more declarative way to configure Storybook since v5.3.
- Uses `Component Story Format`, the recommended way to write stories since Storybook 5.2. The format is a portable, open standard for authoring Storybook stories in pure ES6 modules.
